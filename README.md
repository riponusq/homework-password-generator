This is the homework of Password Generator using javaScript . I tried to make it as good as I can.

I used variable for all posible characters and symbol and special character.
Creates user prompt to select password length.
Creates confirm for lowercase.
creates confirm for uppercase.
Creates confirm for special characters.
Creates confirm for symbols.
When all prompts are answered a password generated that matches selected criteria.
And also the password is displayed in generated area.
